    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Spaghetti is awesome. Everyone loves it, including children. The noodles are fun to eat because you get to slurp them up like you are a human vaccuum cleaner.</p>
        <p>People that don't like spaghetti are probably not very smart. If you know someone that doesn't like spaghetti, you may want to consider going no-contact with them immediately.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of dry spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>1 jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 package of frozen Italian-style meatballs</li>
            <li>Shredded parmesan cheese (as much as you'd like, don't hold back)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the noodles until they are soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li>Feed one of the noodles to your dog and see if she approves</li>
            <li>Strain the noodles and return to pot</li>
            <li>Add some noodles to a plate and then add some sauce from the pan. You should have been heating this up by the way, oops.</li>
            <li>Add meatballs on top. You were supposed to heat those up too, according to packaging instructions (duh)</li>
            <li>Add a bunch of parmesan cheese to the top.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
